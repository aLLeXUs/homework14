                    <span class="article-time">JULY 25, 2018 11:46 PM PDT</span>
                    <p class="article-text">The next Samsung smartphone to hit the market could have a flexible screen that's unbreakable, delivering the first truly foldable handset.

                        The Korean electronics giant said Wednesday that its recently developed smartphone panel has been certified by Underwriters Laboratories, meaning it's ready for shipping to consumers in actual devices. Samsung said it expects the new panel to have applications in non-phone markets as well, such as automobiles, mobile military devices and portable game consoles, among others.

                        Samsung's efforts to make a foldable phone come as demand for smartphones slows down. It's getting harder for handset makers to differentiate their devices, and consumers don't feel the need to upgrade as often. In the fourth quarter, overall smartphone unit sales fell for the first time ever, according to Gartner.

                        The flexible OLED panel is constructed of an unbreakable substrate with an overlay window adhered to it, Samsung said. Flexible displays currently commercially available tend to shatter when subjected to severe impact.

                        That apparently won't occur with Samsung's new screen.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-title">Windows 10 didn't quite fix forced updates -- but Microsoft's trying again</h3>
                    <span class="article-time">JULY 25, 2018 4:37 PM PDT</span>
                    <p class="article-text">I called it "the most frustrating thing about Windows" -- forced automatic updates that lock you out of your computer until they're done.

                        Last March, Microsoft made some pretty big strides toward solving the issue by letting you snooze an update indefinitely, but it still wasn't quite enough. In the 16 months since, I've still had a couple of instances where my computer tricked me into an update or wrested away control at a particularly inconvenient moment.

                        But according to a new official blog post (as spotted by The Verge), Windows 10 will soon include a new machine learning technique to figure out the best time to restart.

                        "We trained a predictive model that can accurately predict when the right time to restart the device is. Meaning, that we will not only check if you are currently using your device before we restart, but we will also try to predict if you had just left the device to grab a cup of coffee and return shortly after," writes Windows Insider Program head Dona Sarkar.

                        We haven't tried the new model yet, so I'm not sure how well it works, particularly for users like me who tend to only leave their laptops awake when they're in use -- but Microsoft says it's seen "promising results" in internal testing.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-title">Google to let you pop its AI chips into your own computer as of October</h3>
                    <span class="article-time">JULY 25, 2018 1:14 PM PDT</span>
                    <p class="article-text">Google, one of the top companies in the hot area of artificial intelligence, will begin letting customers directly use its custom processors for the technology starting in October.

                        Google's TPUs, or tensor processing units, accelerate AI tasks like understanding voice commands or recognizing objects in photos. Today, Google will let you pay to do that kind of work on its cloud-computing infrastructure. But through a program called Edge TPU announced Wednesday, Google will let programmers install the TPUs in their own machines.

                        "There are also many benefits to be gained from intelligent, real-time decision-making at the point where these devices connect to the network," without having to wait for a trip over the network to Google's machines, Injong Rhee, vice president of Google Cloud's internet of things work, said in a blog post. "Your sensors become more than data collectors -- they make local, real-time, intelligent decisions."

                        AI, also often called machine learning or deep learning and using a brain-inspired technology called neural networks, is a profound change for computing. It lets people train computers using real-world data and figure out patterns for themselves, like what a pedestrian in front of a self-driving car looks like or how to pick the right exposure for a sunset photo.

                        Even though Google's chips are escaping its data centers, they aren't going as far as some. There's a race on for AI chips that will work in phones and other mobile devices.

                        Google offers AI services on its cloud-computing infrastructure, letting customers pay as they go to use the technology. Letting customers use Google's AI chips in their own computers could significantly expand the number of customers and the number of jobs interested in Google's AI technology. There's a good chance they're already using Google's TensorFlow software that the TPUs are designed to run.

                        Google's move also makes it a tighter competitor with Microsoft's Azure computing service, which plans to extend its own AI processing technology to customers through an effort called Project Brainwave.

                        Google's TPUs will be available in a hardware module that can be plugged into a computer using a PCI Express expansion slot -- common in servers -- or a USB port. Interested Google cloud AI customers can apply online for access to Google's AI chips.</p>

                    <span class="article-time">JULY 25, 2018 10:41 AM PDT</span>
                    <p class="article-text">You're killing us, Google.

                        Android P  was only supposed to get three betas, you told CNET at the Google I/O developer conference in May, before you announced the official name. And yet, Android P beta 4 arrived Wednesday, and now you're blogging that the official Android P unveiling is coming "soon."

                        While the Android P Beta 4 update is so very close to final -- you call it "a release candidate build with final system behaviors" -- the fourth beta means we're still waiting to see what Google calls the next version of its OS. Could it be Popsicle? Popcorn ball?

                        The final Android P is expected to come to phones this fall. It supports a notch screen design, gesture navigation and some fresh updates to the phone's look and feel.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-title">Intel Core i9-9900K may boost to 5GHz</h3>
                    <span class="article-time">JULY 25, 2018 10:28 AM PDT</span>
                    <p class="article-text">Specs for the two as-yet unannounced CPUs in the next generation of Intel processors may have seeped out onto the web. If they're correct, Intel is bumping both the i9-9900K and i7-9700K to eight cores; the i9-9900K will get a boost clock to 5GHz on two of the cores and up to 4.7GHz on all. Intel's K series of processors are the unlocked versions that can be overclocked.

                        The i7-9700K however, will be very close -- it will boost to 4.9GHz on a single core (4.8GHz on two), or 4.6GHz on all cores. The difference is the i7 is dropping hyperthreading, the technology that gives you eight threads on a quad-core processor, for example. At four cores, the most common popular optimization for most software, the i7-9700K boosts to 4.7GHz and the i9-9900K to 4.8GHz. So the gap between the the two processors many not be that large for tasks that don't take advantage of hyperthreading or more cores.

                        Wccftech found a confirmation of the ninth-gen processors in Intel's microcode update guidance a few weeks ago, but other specs -- and SiSoft Sandra benchmark results for the i7-9700K -- have also surfaced.

                        Although they're ninth-generation in name and model number, the processors use a variation of the eighth-generation Coffee Lake architecture dubbed Coffee Lake-S.

                        Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

                    <span class="article-time">JULY 25, 2018 6:10 AM PDT</span>
                    <p class="article-text">A Mozilla executive says Google's redesign has made YouTube slower on Firefox and Edge.

                        Chris Peterson, the software community's technical program manager, tweeted on Tuesday that the video sharing site loads at a fifth of the speed on non-Chrome browsers due to its architecture, as first reported by Sofpedia.
                        "YouTube's Polymer redesign relies on the deprecated Shadow DOM v0 API only implemented in Chrome," he wrote.

                        "YouTube serves a Shadow DOM polyfill to Firefox and Edge that is, unsurprisingly, slower than Chrome's native implementation. On my laptop, initial page load takes 5 seconds with the polyfill vs 1 without. Subsequent page navigation perf is comparable."

                        Peterson suggested fixes for both Firefox -- Mozilla's browser -- and Microsoft's Edge that revert YouTube to a previous version using add-ons. </p>

                    <span class="article-time">JULY 25, 2018 6:01 AM PDT</span>
                    <p class="article-text">SpaceX successfully launched another of its reusable block 5 Falcon 9 boosters from California early Wednesday.

                        The rocket deployed 10 satellites for sat-phone company Iridium from Vandenburg Air Force Base at 4:39 a.m. PT, in the seventh of eight scheduled launches of 75 satellites that'll be used to upgrade the company's constellation.

                        Elon Musk's SpaceX reported that it was able to land the booster on the droneship "Just Read the Instructions," stationed in the Pacific, despite rough weather. It was unable to catch either half of the nose cone using its giant net mounted on the ship "Mr. Steven," however, even though the net is larger than the one used in the last attempt.</p>
